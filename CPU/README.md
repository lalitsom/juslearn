# CPU


## Assignments (Use any programming language)
1. Write a program which make use of ~100% CPU (single core).
2. Write a program which make use of ~50% CPU (single core).
3. Write a program which make use of ~100% CPU (all cores).
3. Write a program which make use of ~50% CPU (all cores).


First assignment code : [assignment1.cpp](assignment1.cpp)

<!-- terminal block -->
```bash
~/projects/juslearn/CPU % gcc assignment1.cpp
~/projects/juslearn/CPU % time ./a.out
count of operations  10000000000
./a.out  9.35s user 0.02s system 98% cpu 9.547 total





# Learnings to target
- what is CPU?
- what is core? how many your system have?
- what is the speed of single cpu on your machine? what is the way to measure it?
- what does it mean, when your cpu is 10% utilized or 100% utilized?
- understand top command and time command output
- what is the difference between user, system and real time?
- what is IO bound and CPU bound?
